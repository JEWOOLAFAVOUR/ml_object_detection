# 🎓 Supervisor Presentation Guide

## 📋 5-Minute Demo Script

### 1. Introduction (30 seconds)
"Good [morning/afternoon]! I've built a real-time object detection system using SSD MobileNet v2 architecture. The system can identify 80 different object categories in images with high accuracy and speed."

### 2. System Overview (1 minute)
"Let me show you the web interface I developed..."

**[Open the Streamlit app]**
- Point out the clean, professional interface
- Highlight the real-time processing capabilities
- Show the adjustable confidence threshold control

### 3. Live Demonstration (2 minutes)
**[Upload a test image with multiple objects]**

"Watch as the system processes this image in real-time..."

**Point out:**
- Detection speed (usually 0.1-0.5 seconds)
- Bounding boxes around detected objects
- Confidence scores for each detection
- Object classification accuracy

**[Try different confidence thresholds]**
- Show how lowering threshold finds more objects
- Demonstrate the trade-off between sensitivity and accuracy
